# iOS Development

A practical approach to create iOS apps.

> "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." — Leonardo da Vinci

## How to start

The very first step should be **paper prototyping**. Download [the template](./pdf/ux-design-templates.pdf), then scetch your main screen. Annotate the paper prototype with information about possible user interactions. Use *real* data for text, images and symbols, as shown in [this example](./pdf/ux-design-demos.pdf). Discuss the user interface with users of your target group.
