## Life Cycle Events

In Section Demo Projects for Chapter 1 Intro

An app can be in several states according to its life cycle:

* inactive
* active
* background

When an app enters a different state, an event is triggered. For example,
put code into `.onAppear(){...` and `.onDisappear(){...` callback / code block of a view.

For example, stop activities when the app looses focus (and other apps come in the forground).
